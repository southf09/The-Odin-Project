# Welcome to my Bookshelf!


## How To Use
- Click the 'Add Book' button to add a new book to your bookshelf
- You can clear a book from your bookshelf at any time by clicking the 'Clear' button


## Key Concepts Covered
- Constructor Functions: books will be individually created and stored in the bookshelf
- DOM Manipulation: allows the user to manipulate the HTML and CSS classes of new and existing elements
- Hidden Forms: a hidden form that contains the input form for book creation waits to be summoned
- Event Listeners: multiple event listeners are used in this project, to provide functionality ranging from showing hidden forms, to 
submitting a book form

## Coming Improvements
- Improved CSS styling: the styling is currently very basic as I continue to focus on function rather than form
- Local storage will be added to save sessions for later use
